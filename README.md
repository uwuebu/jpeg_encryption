# JPEG encryption using chaotic maps
Program to encrypt/decrypt and test the experimental algorithm that uses chaotic maps for an efficient and secure JPEG image encryption.
Algorithm is based on the one developed by Peng Y., Fu C., Cao G., Song W., Chen J., Sham: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/375786229_JPEG-Compatible_Joint_Image_Compression_and_Encryption_Algorithm_with_File_Size_Preservation
